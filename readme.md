Description

It was written in a quick-and-dirty style. Pragmatism above all and no overengineering.

Technologies used

Sample usage
------------

Find a website displaying current time. Set WW to monitor current hour and minute. Wait a while.

Remarks
-------

WW has never been tested on websites which change content using only js.
